    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Pita bread;</li>
        <li>3 table spoons of tomato sauce;</li>
        <li>2-3 slices of any tipe of cheese, although mozarella has been proven to work particularly well;</li>
        <li>1 portion of tuna, chicken breast, ham, or another protein of your choice;</li>
        <li>1 handful of arugula leaves, or another leafy green of your choice;</li>
        <li>1 obligatory dash of spicy sauce;</li>
        <li>1 pinch of salt and spices of your choice;</li>
        <li>Tomatoes, mushrooms, and veggies of your choice.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a frying pan on the stove.</li>
        <li>Lay your pita bread on the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce over it.</li>
        <li>Add your cheese, protein, leafy greens, and all of your other ingredients.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Don't be lazy. If you're using mushrooms, saute them beforehand, or they will taste terrible. Trust me.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Timing is key here. Aim to have your cheese well melted, your extra ingredients hot, and the pita bread with a nice and crispy golden crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle any spices you desire onto your pita, and don't forget to put a dash of hot sauce.</li>
        <li>Fold the pita. It has now become a sandwich.</li>
        <li>Serve it on a plate.</li>
        <li>Wait till they're cool, or till you're cool enough to eat them hot.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
