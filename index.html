    <p>A collection of recipes for the desperate hungry student.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Lucas. I am a biomedical science and coding student.
        This website was built as part of the curriculum of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">Odin Project's</a>
        course on HTML.
    </p>
    <p>This website is built with nothing but very basic HTML. To see more developped projects of mine, check out my <a href="https://github.com/JLucasGaldino/">GitHub profile!</a></p>
    <p>These recipes come mostly from my experience living with some friends in my first year of university. They are pretty terrible,
        both in nutrition and taste. But they made an excellent choice of recipes for this page!
    </p>
