# odin-recipes
## Description
This simple cooking recipes website was built in the context of the introductory course to web development, from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

## Concepts practiced
The purpose of this website is to serve as a practice for basic skills in HTML, CSS and usage of Git and GitHub. 
In order to properly follow the course curriculum, I've decided to start by using only HTML and no CSS in this project. 
As the curriculum evolves and more concepts are touched on, I will be adding more CSS to the website.
