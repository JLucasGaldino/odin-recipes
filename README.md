# odin-recipes
## Description
This simple cooking recipes website was built in the context of the introductory course to web development, from [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com).

## Concepts practiced
The purpose of this website is to serve as a practice for basic skills in HTML and usage of Git and GitHub. 
In order to properly follow the course curriculum, I've decided to use only HTML and no CSS in this project. If you'd like to see more advanced projects in my portfolio, please refer to my [GitHub page](https://github.com/JLucasGaldino/)
